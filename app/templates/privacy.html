    <h2>Here are privacy and terms and conditions</h2>
    <p>
        Your name will not be sent to the server, only BOID is sent to the server for getting the IPO results.
        You do not have to fill name field, it's only for your own reference so that you will know whose BOID
        got the IPO or not. Even if you fill the name, it will be stored in your device only and will not be
        sent to the server.
    </p>

    <p>
        TIP
    </p>


    <p>
        Add the site to your homescreen, you can then directly see the results by a single click. Once you fill the form,
        you don't have to fill the form again and again.
